# Overview
Welcome to the 2025 Kaggle Playground Series! We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting and approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

Your goal: Predict the probability that a patient will be diagnosed with diabetes.

# Evaluation
The evaluation section describes how submissions will be scored and how participants should format their submissions. You don't need a sub-title at the top; the page title appears above. Below is an example of a typical evaluation page.

Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

# Submission File
For each id in the test set, you must predict a probability for the diagnosed_diabetes variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:
